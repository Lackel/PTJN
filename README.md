# Robust Pseudo Label Training and Source Domain Joint-training Network (PTJN)
Data and code for paper titled [New User Intent Discovery with Robust Pseudo
Label Training and Source Domain Joint-training](-) (IEEE Intelligent Systems)

*New (User) Intent Discovery (NID)* aims at discovering new intents from unlabeled data and then classifying inputs into proper (known or new) intents. In this paper, we propose a robust Pseudo label Training and source domain Joint training Network (PTJN) to generate robust pseudo labels for unlabeled data and fully utilize prior knowledge from labeled data.

## Data
We performed experiments on three public datasets: [clinc](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1131/), [banking](https://aclanthology.org/2020.nlp4convai-1.5/) and [stackoverflow](https://aclanthology.org/W15-1509/), which have been included in our repository in the data folder ' ./data '.

## Model
Our model mainly contains three components: Extractor for feature extraction, Generator for generating pseudo labels through clustering and Corrector for refining the noisy pseudo labels generated by Generator.

## Requirements
* python==3.8
* pytorch==1.11.0
* transformers==4.19.2
* scipy==1.8.0
* numpy==1.21.6
* scikit-learn==1.1.1

## Running
Pre-training, training and testing our model through the bash scripts:
```
sh scripts/run.sh
```
You can also add or change parameters in run.sh (More parameters are listed in init_parameter.py)

## Results

It should be noted that the experimental results may be different because of the randomness of clustering when testing even though we fixed the random seeds.
